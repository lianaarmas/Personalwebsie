<h1>Liana Armas</h1>
	<p>My name is Liana Armas and I was born in Cuba. I came to the U.S when I was 2 years old. I've lived in Austin for most of my life except for when I moved to Florida and lived there in 4th grade. I like it better here in Austin because it's where all my frinds and family are at.</p>

	<p>My birthday is June 12 and my zodiac is a gemini. My favorite hobby is reading. I love just sitting down and relaxing with a good book. When I grow up my dream is to move to New York and go to NYU.

<h2>My Favorite Things</h2>
